## üéØ Project Overview & My Journey

As someone transitioning into data analytics, I chose this credit card customer segmentation project to demonstrate my ability to transform complex business data into actionable insights. This wasn't just about applying clustering algorithms‚Äîit was about discovering how sophisticated analytics can challenge traditional assumptions and unlock hidden value in financial data.

**What attracted me to this project:**
- **Real Business Problem**: Credit card companies need to understand diverse customer behaviors to optimize risk and revenue
- **Technical Challenge**: Unsupervised learning with complex, multi-dimensional behavioral data  
- **Strategic Impact**: Potential to identify millions in revenue opportunities through better customer classification

**What I aimed to demonstrate:**
- Advanced feature engineering for financial data
- Rigorous model validation and statistical testing
- Translation of technical findings into business strategy
- Professional-grade analysis documentation and presentation

This analysis reveals a critical insight: **payment behavior matters more than spending volume for risk assessment**‚Äîa finding that could reshape how financial institutions evaluate their customers.

## üîç Methodology & Technical Approach

### 1. **Advanced Feature Engineering (38 features created)**
Starting with 18 raw variables, I engineered sophisticated behavioral indicators:

- **Payment Behavior Ratios**: `payment_to_balance_ratio`, `min_payment_ratio`, `spending_sustainability`
- **Credit Utilization Metrics**: `credit_utilization_ratio`, `effective_utilization`, `debt_to_limit`
- **Cash Flow Analysis**: `net_cash_flow`, `cash_advance_dependency`, `months_to_payoff`
- **Activity Patterns**: `total_activity`, `avg_purchase_size`, `financial_stress`
- **Composite Risk Scores**: `payment_risk_score`, `customer_value_score`

### 2. **Rigorous Feature Selection (32 final features)**
- **Variance Threshold Analysis**: Removed low-variance features (threshold: 0.01)
- **Correlation Matrix Optimization**: Eliminated highly correlated features (threshold: 0.9)
- **Statistical Result**: Preserved 32 discriminative features from original 38

### 3. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Log Transformation**: Applied to right-skewed financial distributions to normalize extreme ranges
- **Robust Scaling**: Used RobustScaler for outlier resilience while preserving business-critical patterns
- **Outlier Strategy**: Retained all data points to preserve legitimate high-value customer patterns

### 4. **Clustering Implementation & Validation**
- **Algorithm Selection**: K-means with comprehensive metric evaluation (Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, Elbow)
- **Optimal K=5**: Determined through multi-metric consensus and business interpretability
![Clustering Implementation](images/output.png)
- **Validation Framework**: 
  - Bootstrap analysis: 82% model stability across samples
  - Noise resilience: Stable performance with up to 14% data perturbation
  - Cross-validation: ARI scores consistently 0.80-0.85
  - Statistical significance: All features p < 0.001
![Validation Framework](images/output2.png)

### 5. **Multi-Perspective Visualization**
- **PCA**: 49.7% variance explained in 2 components (moderate separation)
- **t-SNE**: Excellent cluster boundaries with minimal overlap
- **UMAP**: Superior cluster definition, used for final validation

## üéØ Key Findings & Customer Segments

### **5 Distinct Customer Behavioral Profiles**
![Customer Behavioral Profiles](images/output3.png)

| Segment | Size | Profile | Payment Discipline | Risk Level |
|---------|------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **üí∏ Emergency Borrowers** | 19.7% | Cash advance dependent | Poor (30% above minimum) | üö® High Risk (78.7 score) |
| **üõ°Ô∏è Conservative Users** | 12.2% | Low-activity, stable | Moderate (60% above minimum) | ‚úÖ Low Risk (46.2 score) |
| **üí∞ Hidden Gems** | 5.3% | **High-volume sophisticated managers** | **Excellent (90% above minimum)** | ‚úÖ **Lower Risk** |
| **üèÜ Premium Transactors** | 14.2% | High-value, low-risk customers | Premium (40% full + 50% above minimum) | ‚úÖ Lowest Risk (11.9 score) |
| **üè¶ Persistent Revolvers** | 48.6% | Mainstream debt carriers | Struggling (35% minimum only) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk (57.7 score) |

### **Critical Strategic Discovery**

**‚ö° Payment Behavior > Usage Volume for Risk Assessment**

The analysis revealed a fundamental flaw in traditional risk models:
- **Hidden Gem Segment** (5.3% of customers): Uses $5,102 in cash advances but maintains **90% above-minimum payment rate**
- Traditional models would classify these as high-risk due to usage volume
- Reality: They demonstrate the **best payment discipline** in the entire portfolio
- **Business Impact**: These customers represent premium growth opportunities, not risks

### **Behavioral Hierarchy Discovery**
Payment discipline creates clear customer value tiers:
- **Premium**: 90% above minimum (Clusters 2 & 3)
- **Stable**: 60-65% above minimum (Clusters 1 & 4) 
- **High Risk**: 30% above minimum (Cluster 0)
